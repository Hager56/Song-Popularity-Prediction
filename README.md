Developed a predictive model to estimate the popularity of songs based on their audio features before release. Utilized a dataset containing various audio attributes and corresponding popularity scores (ranging from 0 to 100). Conducted comprehensive data analysis and feature engineering to identify key determinants of a song's success. Implemented machine learning algorithms to forecast song popularity, achieving significant accuracy in predictions. The project provided insights into how specific audio characteristics influence listener reception and market performance.
